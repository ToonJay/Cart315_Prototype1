Notes:
- The game as it is seems to be working fine (on a technical level)
- Camera and controls are fine
- Good sense of speed
- Speed increase should be incremental rather than instantanious
- Jump is too slow
- Levels should be wider
- The mechanic of the speed-up pellets is nice
- Needs obstacles and ways where speed can drop
- Lack of basic functions like respawning, a menu, pausing, etc. 

Reflections:
It seems I've made a decent foundation for a game.
Seems like most of the work would be on adding variety on the levels and polish.

I'll definitely make the levels wider to allow variety and intensity in gameplay.
Doing so will require adjustments on the strafing speed.
I could also make it vary from level to level as well.

I'll definitely need to make all the basic functions any game requires.
I'll need menus, pausing, respawning, exiting, etc.
This will most likely be my focus next time I work on this.

If I make ways to slow down the player, I want to make it so that it doesn't
make them stop, but merely lower their speed. Need to make it so that it's punishing,
without it being too infuriating. Making the player go into a complete stop each time
would ruin the overall sense of speed, imo.

The jump definitely needs some tweaking.
While doing a big air is nice, it stops being fun when it takes too long and
feels like you're slowing down.

Need to make the players stay on their toes without the game getting too infuriating.
There ofcourse needs to be room for error, tho less as the levels go on.
