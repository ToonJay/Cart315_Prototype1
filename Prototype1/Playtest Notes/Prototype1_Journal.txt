Design Question: I'm just testing out the mechanic of going down a slope, as if skiing or snowboarding.

Prototype Questions:

1. How are the controls?

They're fine.

2. How's the view? 

It's fine since I can see well infront of me.


3. Is the starting speed too slow?

No, especially since the first pellets are pretty close.

4. Is strafing too slow?

With the wideness of the level, no.

5. What do you think of collecting pellets to increase your speed when sliding down?

Feels good, but basing the whole levels on collecting pellets might be boring.

6. Do you like the overall sense of speed?

Feels good. However, the speed increase would be better if it were gradual rather than instantanious whenever collecting pellets and whatnot.

7. How's the jumping?

The jumping could be faster (as in the rise and fall). Having dedicated jumps that follow your direction makes it feel like
an actual game where you go down a slope.

8. What do you think of the ramp that increases your jump height? It was used for the end,
but ramps like these can be in the middle of the level as well.

Having these in the middle of the level would be nice.
However, the one at the end should make you jump much higher since it's the big finish of a level.

9. Was the test level too difficult or frustrating?

Nope.


Feel free to add any extra comments and/or suggestions.

There should be obstacles and ways for your speed to decrease.
Levels should be wider, and in consequence the strafing speed should be faster.
Hopefully the levels are much longer too.
Needs basic functions like respawning and a menu.
